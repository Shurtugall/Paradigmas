findkeywords([],[[memory,0],[none,0]]).
findkeywords([H|T],[[H,I]|T1]) :- rules([[H,I]|_]), !, findkeywords(T,T1).
findkeywords([_|T],T1) :- findkeywords(T,T1).

O sistema usa de palavras "chave" para responder algumas perguntas, as funções
buscam essas palavras utilizando o sistema Head and Tail para trabalhar com listas!

Outra parte que podemos destacar é a utilização da tabela ASCII para verificar os
caracteres. Para cada caractere precisamos ter uma resposta do sistema
% my_char_type(+Char,?Type)
%    Char is an ASCII code.
%    Type is whitespace, punctuation, numeric, alphabetic, or special.

my_char_type(46,period) :- !.
my_char_type(X,alphanumeric) :- X >= 65, X =< 90, !.
my_char_type(X,alphanumeric) :- X >= 97, X =< 123, !.
my_char_type(X,alphanumeric) :- X >= 48, X =< 57, !.
my_char_type(X,whitespace) :- X =< 32, !.
my_char_type(X,punctuation) :- X >= 33, X =< 47, !.
my_char_type(X,punctuation) :- X >= 58, X =< 64, !.
my_char_type(X,punctuation) :- X >= 91, X =< 96, !.
my_char_type(X,punctuation) :- X >= 123, X =< 126, !.
my_char_type(_,special).
